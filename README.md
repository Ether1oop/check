# Problematic Event Logging Parameter Checker for Gas Saving
To show the feasibility of automatic event logging assistance from our findings, we design a simple problematic event logging parameter checker which helps identify gas saving opportunities. 

The checker is motivated by the non-neglectable number of parameter changes that replace Storage type variable with Memory type variable.

It supported by [python-solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/python-solidity-parser)
